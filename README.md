This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Firebase Realtime Database: attempting to access data before it's fully loaded. The `bug.js` file showcases the error, and `bugSolution.js` provides the solution.  This issue often manifests when immediately using data from an `onValue` listener before Firebase has had a chance to populate it. The solution involves proper asynchronous handling using Promises or async/await to ensure data is ready before use.
